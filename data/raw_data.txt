55662 PEOPLE WERE IN A STADIUM IN BUCHAREST HUNGARY FOR THE HUNGARY/PORTUGAL MATCH! JUST SAYING. @MITHISA_MOTHO @THABOMAKWAKWA @INSIGHTFACTOR
PORTUGAL  FRANCE NEXT  I LOVE THESE TWO TEAMS
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T SEEN Q FULL MATCH IN THE EUROS SAW BIT OF 1ST HALF AND 2ND HALF OF ENGLAND AND DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT TILL THE END AS I WAS GOING OUT. THEN PORTUGAL LAST 5 MINS OF 1ST APPROX AND 2ND HALF. NOT THAT FREE AT FIRST THEN NOT INTERESTED IN ALL MATCHES
JUST PLEASE LET PORTUGAL LOSE THIS CHAMPIONSHIP CANT STAND THEM
NO SUCH THING AS COVID IN HUNGARY? GREAT TO SEE A FULL AND BUZZING STADIUM.    RONALDO  PORTUGAL 
PORTUGAL HAS A STRONG SQUAD BUT NEEDS TO BE LESS CONSERVATIVE. PLAYING W/ 2 HOLDING MIDFIELDERS REALLY SLOWED THE TEAM DOWN. NO SPARK. NO SPEED. NO CREATIVITY. RENATO SHOULD START. IF THINGS ARENT WORKING WE NEED TO BE QUICKER W/ SUBS. LOTS OF STRONG OPTIONS TO BE WAITING AROUND

CLIVE AND ALLY'S ANALYSIS IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES HAS BEEN MORE DETAILED THAN THE ANALYSIS IN THE FULL 90 MINUTES PORTUGAL HUNGARY GAME.
WHILST THEY ARE TELLING US TO DO STAYCATION I CAN TRAVEL TO PORTUGAL OR SPAIN 4*/5* ACCOMODATION INCLUDING PCR TESTS FOR DAY 2 AND 8 AND THE HOLIDAY WOULD BE CHEAPER THAN ME TRAVELLING TO DEVON OR CORNWALL MAKE IT MAKE SENSE PLEASEEE
SWITCHING BRUNO FERNANDES TO THE NO. 10 ROLE AND PLAYING 2 DMS BEHIND HIM MIGHT JUST WIN PORTUGAL THE CHAMPIONSHIP. HE IS YOUR BEST PLAYER CURRENTLY SO YOU HAVE TO PLAY TO HIS STRENGTH #EURO2020
